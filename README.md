I wrote this program as a project for my 'Inteligent User Interfaces' course during my 2nd Year Computer Science BSc at Maastricht University. The project's goal was to study the difference in user reception through statistical analysis and emotion models to two interfaces performing the same task. Except one interface had this task automated, and the other didn't.
